    <p>
      This is a tool for making music together in times of quarantine.
      Still work in progress.  To try anyway (no guarantees!), proceed as
      indicated below.
    </p>
    <p>Notes/recommendations</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        At each page you will have to select the sample rate.  48000 Hz is
        the only one that really makes sense here, since 44100 Hz is not
        supported by the Opus codec (RFC 7587).  However it seems some systems
        have the recording rate set to 44100 Hz by default, you have to choose
        44100 Hz on those (or proceed as indicated in the next bullet point.)
      </li>
      <li>
        On Ubuntu, it can happen that the default sample rate is 44100 Hz.
        In this case, you are encouraged to switch to 48000 Hz by
        adding the line "default-sample-rate = 48000" to /etc/pulse/daemon.conf.
        (Remove the initial "; " if present.) 
      </li>
      <li>
        In any case the sample rate for the session and all clients must match.
      </li>
      <li>
        This only works with Firefox at the moment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Error signaling is still mostly via the developer console.  Enter
        Ctrl + Shift + K on each page to open it and keep it open.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Steps to use:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Unplug your headphones.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the <a href="crosscorrelation.html">latency detector</a> to measure
        the latency of your system.  Note down the value once it stabilizes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now use your headphones.
      </li>
      <li>
        Open the <a href="streamserver.html">session manager</a> in a new tab.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click the start button and copy the session ID to the clipboard.
      </li>
      <li>Open the <a href="client.html">client</a> in a new tab.  (If you
        can memorize the rest of these instructions, same tab is fine.)</li>
      <li>
        Enter the session ID and your system latency and click start.
        Now you can already rock solo.
      </li>
      <li>
        Share the session ID with your friends and play together.
      </li>
    </ol>
