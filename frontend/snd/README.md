This folder contains the sound files necessary for the frontend.
The only sound necessary is the click sound used for the metronome and
for the synchronization mechanism.  This is contained in a file
CDCdh_K1close_CLHat-07.wav.  Because of
https://github.com/ntgiwsvp/looper/issues/1, this file cannot be included in
the git repository.  Please download from the location mentioned in the issue
and add here on any local clones.
